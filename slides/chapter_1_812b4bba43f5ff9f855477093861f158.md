## Getting started with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "45a44c3164"
```

`@script`
Now we are going to get our hands on Scikit-image and start with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization.

## Thresholding

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "2bb9b49fda"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
Partitioning an image into a foreground and background, converting grayscale images into binary images.

e.g. The function T(pixel) will return: {{2}}

- 255 (white) if pixel **>** thresh value {{2}}
- 0 (black) if pixel **<** thresh value {{2}}


Works better in gray-scale images because these only use one channel. {{3}}


`@part2`

`@script`
Thresholding help us to separate objects from a background by creating a binary image from a grayscale one.

Essentially, its converting it completely black and white. Is simplest method, yet effective, of image segmentation, something that we will cover in more detail later on, in the course. 

In this way, is a function that takes 2 arguments: the image pixel and a thresh value to compare with.

It will return a white pixel, which is 255, if the pixel that's evaluating is greater than the thresh. And will return a black pixel otherwise.

Here we can see how it takes effect on an image. 

Works best in grayscale images because these only use one channel.

## Inverted thresholding

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "a9ac55415c"
```

`@part1`
The opposite of the positive thresholding.
 
The function T(pixel) will return: {{1}}

- 255 (white) if pixel **<** thresh value {{1}}
- 0 (black) if pixel **>** thresh value {{1}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/e418d89a0a22e0660ac6d7abeca46d18fa81977f/camera_inverted_thresholding.png){{1}}


`@script`
There is also inverted thresholding, this acts just in the opposite way of the positive thresholding, the one that we just saw.

The background of this image, instead of being white (which is 255), is black (0).

## Apply it

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "714e04f902"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
```python
import skimage.data as data

image = data.camera()

thresh = 127

```{{1}}
```python
thresholded_image = image > thresh
inv_thresholded_image = image <= thresh

show_images(image, 
            thresholded_image, 
            inv_thresholded_image)
```{{2}}
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/68321ee87a6c9805730b7aa83586f6df8e34ed28/all_thresholding.png){{2}}


`@part2`
The module data in scikit image contains multiple images for testing. {{1}}

We apply thresholding using the "**>**" operator. {{2}} 

To apply inverted thresholding we can use "**<=**" operator. {{2}}


`@script`
Let's now apply it.

First we need an image to work on, for this we'll use a module from scikitimage that includes many for testing reasons. We import the module, then choose a grayscaled image: camera, set the thresh value to 127, a midpoint between 0 and 255.

We apply thresholding on an image using the grater than operator followed of the thresh. 

For inverted thresholding, use the less or equal than operator. 

Finally show the images using a pre-loaded function that uses matplotlib, called show_images, to help us focus on scikit-image.

## Types of Thresholding

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "74c101ba7b"
```

`@part1`
- **Histogram based:** The histogram of the pixelsâ€™ intensity is used and certain assumptions are made on the properties of this histogram. Good for images with uniform backgrounds. {{1}}
- **Local:** Processes a pixel, only the neighboring pixels are used. Best for images with large variation in the background intensity. Often require more computation time. {{1}}

![](image-url)

Some methods included in scikit-image are: {{2}}

Isodata, li, mean, minimum, otsu, triangle and yen.{{2}}


`@script`
There are two categories of thresholding in scikit-image:
Histogram based. The histogram is a graphical representation of the frequency distribution of the pixels intensity values. Is good for uniform backgrounds.
Local: used to process a pixel, where only the neighboring pixels are used. Best for images where the background is not easily differentiated.

Methods as Isodata, Li and otsu are included in scikit-image.

## What thresholding algorithm to use

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "f817589f10"
```

`@part1`
```python
from skimage import data
from skimage.filters import try_all_threshold

image = data.page()

fig, ax = try_all_threshold(image, verbose=False)

show_plot()

``` {{1}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/66a70de36e3e27742742ec170a947fa4e98bdaa5/trying_all_alg_horizontal.png) {{1}}


`@script`
You might be asking what algorithm would be better to use. It's okay if you don't know in deep how these methods work, scikit-image includes a function to evaluate them so you can choose the one that best suits you.

This is the try_all_threshold function, from the filters module.

Here we import it, set the image from data, use the function and show results.

## Bimodal histogram and calculating the optimal thresh

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "3306dc3ade"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
```python
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu

image = data.camera()

optimal_thresh = threshold_otsu(image) 
``` {{1}}
```python
thresholded_image = image > optimal_thresh

compare_images_bimodal(image, thresholded_image, optimal_thresh)
```{{2}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/fe54cd5bbd915b2379abdbcac98bfcb10ff4cf40/optimal_thresh.png){{2}}


`@script`
Previously, we manually set the thresh value, but a better way to know what thresh could work better on an image is to calculate the optimal with a bimodal histogram method. In this case the otsu algorithm.

This is a clustering-based method that maximizes the variance between two classes of pixels, separated by the threshold.

And is done with the threshold_otsu function.

Faster than manually trying numbers.

We can see how the optimal thresh is spotted by a red line in the histogram.


---
## Local thresholding

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e35b09e530"
```

`@part1`
Best for images with different lighting conditions and that doesn't have high contrast
```python
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu, threshold_local

image = data.page()
block_size = 35

local_thresh = threshold_local(image, block_size, offset=10)
local_thresholded = image > local_thresh

show_image(local_thresholded)
``` {{1}}
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/6e1089abb6cbe6c1041c9953d42e777670c9937c/local_thresholding.png) {{1}}


`@script`
If the image doesn't have high contrast, local or adaptive thresholding produce better results. 

With threshold_local function, we calculate thresholds in regions with a characteristic block_size (35) surrounding each pixel; aka local neighborhoods, offset of 10 and apply that local thresh.

We can see it works very well in this image that has different lighting conditions through it.

## Histogram Equalization

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "a3c2191b37"
```

`@part1`
- Histogram equalization is a technique used to enhance contrast in images.

```python
from skimage import data
from skimage import exposure

image = data.moon()

img_eq =  exposure.equalize_hist(image)

img_adapthist = exposure.equalize_adapthist(image, clip_limit=0.03)

show_images(image, img_eq, img_adapthist)
```{{1}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/5709225eb725b7f283625fcd25a77d60c4794969/histogram_equalization.png){{1}}


`@script`
Remember that histogram is a graphical representation of tonal distribution. 

Histogram equalization is a technique used to enhance contrast. Which spreads out the most frequent intensity values in an image.

Here we use equalize_hist and equalize_adapthist from exposure module. Resulting in better detailed images.

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "14704661f7"
```

`@script`
Its time to practice and make your first image processing script with scikit-image.
