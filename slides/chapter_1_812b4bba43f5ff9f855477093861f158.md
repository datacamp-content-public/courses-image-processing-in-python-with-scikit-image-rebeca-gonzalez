## Getting started with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"

Now we are going to get our hands on Scikit-image and start with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization.

## Thresholding

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "2bb9b49fda"
```

`@part1`
The function T(pixel) will return:

- 255 (black) if pixel **>** thresh value
- 0 (white) if pixel **<** thresh value


```python
import pandas as pd
pd.read_csv(test)
```{{1}}
```python
import pandas as pd
pd.read_csv(test)
```{{2}}


`@part2`
![](){{3}}


`@script`
A function that takes 2 arguments: the image pixel and the thresh value to compare with.

This function will return a black pixel, which is 255 in rbg 

Essentially, its converting the image completely black and white. It's used to create a binary image from a gray-scale one. It's the simplest method, yet effective, of image segmentation, something that we will cover in more detail later on, in the course. It help us to separate objects from a background.
