## Getting started with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization

Now we are going to get our hands on Scikit-image and start with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization.

## Thresholding

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "2bb9b49fda"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
Partitioning an image into a foreground and background, converting grayscale images into binary images.

e.g. The function T(pixel) will return: {{2}}

- 255 (white) if pixel **>** thresh value {{2}}
- 0 (black) if pixel **<** thresh value {{2}}


Works better in gray-scale images because these only use one channel. {{3}}


`@part2`

`@script`
Thresholding help us to separate objects from a background. 

Essentially, its converting the image completely black and white. It's used to create a binary image from a gray-scale one. It's the simplest method, yet effective, of image segmentation, something that we will cover in more detail later on, in the course. 

In this way, is a function that takes 2 arguments: the image pixel and the thresh value to compare with.

The Thresholding function will return a white pixel, which is 255, if the pixel that's evaluating is greater than the thresh value to compare with. And will return a black pixel otherwise.

Here we can see how a positive thresholding takes effect on an image. 

Thresholding works its best in gray-scale images, this is mainly because these images only use one channel.

## Inverted thresholding

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "a9ac55415c"
```

`@part1`
The opposite of the positive thresholding.
 
The function T(pixel) will return: {{1}}

- 255 (white) if pixel **<** thresh value {{1}}
- 0 (black) if pixel **>** thresh value {{1}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/e418d89a0a22e0660ac6d7abeca46d18fa81977f/camera_inverted_thresholding.png){{1}}


`@script`
Another important concept is the Inverted thresholding, this one acts just in the opposite way of the positive thresholding, the one that we just saw.

Here we can see how the background of this image, instead of being white (255), is black (which is 0).

## Apply it

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "714e04f902"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
```python
import skimage.data as data

image = data.camera()

thresh = 127

```{{1}}
```python
thresholded_image = image > thresh

show_images(image, thresholded_image)
```{{2}}
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/de9a4ae8aed79a5570320ec2e348b1f3673022e2/camera_thresholding_row.png){{2}}


`@part2`
The module data in scikit image contains multiple images for testing. {{1}}


`@script`
Let's now apply it.

First we need an image to work on, for this we'll use a module from scikit-image that includes many images for testing reasons. We import the module, then choose a grayscaled image called camera, set the thresh value to 127, which is the whole number of the midpoint between 0 and 255.

We apply thresholding on an image using the grater than symbol followed of the thresh value.


---
## Apply it calculating the mean thresh value 

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "55a097fa27"
```

`@part1`
```python
import skimage.data as data
from skimage.filters import threshold_mean

image = data.camera()

thresh = threshold_mean(image)

```{{1}}
```python
thresholded_image = image > thresh
inv_thresholded_image = image <= thresh

show_images(img, thresholded_image, inv_thresholded_image)
```{{2}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/68321ee87a6c9805730b7aa83586f6df8e34ed28/all_thresholding.png){{2}}


`@script`
In the previous example we manually set the thresh value, but a better way to know what thresh value could work better on an image is to calculate it based on the mean of grayscale values.

So the thresh will be a mean value of the pixel intensities in the image.

It's possible that this is not the optimal thresh and many times it's used as a guess value.

## Types of Thresholding

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "74c101ba7b"
```

`@part1`
- Histogram-based. The histogram of the pixelsâ€™ intensity is used and certain assumptions are made on the properties of this histogram (e.g. bimodal).
- Local. To process a pixel, only the neighboring pixels are used. These algorithms often require more computation time.


`@script`
There are mainly two categories of thresholding in scikit-image
