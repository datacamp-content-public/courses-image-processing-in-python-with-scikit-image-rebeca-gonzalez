## Getting started with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization

```yaml

```

Now we are going to get our hands on Scikit-image and start with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization.

## Thresholding

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "2bb9b49fda"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
Partitioning an image into a foreground and background, converting grayscale images into binary images.

e.g. The function T(pixel) will return: {{2}}

- 255 (white) if pixel **>** thresh value {{2}}
- 0 (black) if pixel **<** thresh value {{2}}


Works better in gray-scale images because these only use one channel. {{3}}


`@part2`

`@script`
Thresholding help us to separate objects from a background. 

Essentially, its converting the image completely black and white. It's used to create a binary image from a gray-scale one. It's the simplest method, yet effective, of image segmentation, something that we will cover in more detail later on, in the course. 

In this way, is a function that takes 2 arguments: the image pixel and the thresh value to compare with.

The Thresholding function will return a white pixel, which is 255, if the pixel that's evaluating is greater than the thresh value to compare with. And will return a black pixel otherwise.

Here we can see how a positive thresholding takes effect on an image. 

Thresholding works its best in gray-scale images, this is mainly because these images only use one channel.

## Inverted thresholding

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "a9ac55415c"
```

`@part1`
The opposite of the positive thresholding.
 
The function T(pixel) will return: {{1}}

- 255 (white) if pixel **<** thresh value {{1}}
- 0 (black) if pixel **>** thresh value {{1}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/e418d89a0a22e0660ac6d7abeca46d18fa81977f/camera_inverted_thresholding.png){{1}}


`@script`
Another important concept is the Inverted thresholding, this one acts just in the opposite way of the positive thresholding, the one that we just saw.

Here we can see how the background of this image, instead of being white (255), is black (which is 0).

## Apply it

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "714e04f902"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
```python
import skimage.data as data

image = data.camera()

thresh = 127

```{{1}}
```python
thresholded_image = image > thresh

show_images(image, thresholded_image) 
```{{2}}
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/de9a4ae8aed79a5570320ec2e348b1f3673022e2/camera_thresholding_row.png){{2}}


`@part2`
The module data in scikit image contains multiple images for testing. {{1}}

We apply thresholding using the "**>**" operator. {{2}} 

To apply inverted thresholding we can use "**<=**" operator. {{3}}


`@script`
Let's now apply it.

First we need an image to work on, for this we'll use a module from scikit-image that includes many images for testing reasons. We import the module, then choose a grayscaled image called camera, set the thresh value to 127, which is the whole number of the midpoint between 0 and 255.

We apply thresholding on an image using the grater than operator followed of the thresh value. 

We finally show the image using a pre-loaded function that plots using matplotlib, called show_images() to help us focus on scikit image. 

To apply inverted thresholding, we use the less or equal than operator.


---
## Apply it calculating the mean thresh value 

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "55a097fa27"
```

`@part1`
```python
import skimage.data as data
from skimage.filters import threshold_mean

image = data.camera()

thresh = threshold_mean(image)

```{{1}}
```python
thresholded_image = image > thresh 
inv_thresholded_image = image <= thresh

show_images(img, thresholded_image, inv_thresholded_image)
```{{2}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/68321ee87a6c9805730b7aa83586f6df8e34ed28/all_thresholding.png){{2}}


`@script`
In the previous example we manually set the thresh value, but a better way to know what thresh value could work better on an image is to calculate it based on the mean of the grayscale values.

This is done with the threshold_mean function from the scikit-image filters module.

So the thresh here, will be a mean value of the pixel intensities in the image.

It's possible that this is not the optimal thresh and many times it's used as a guess value. Still, faster than manually trying numbers.

## Types of Thresholding

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "74c101ba7b"
```

`@part1`
- Histogram-based. The histogram of the pixels’ intensity is used and certain assumptions are made on the properties of this histogram (e.g. bimodal).
- Local. To process a pixel, only the neighboring pixels are used. These algorithms often require more computation time.

![](image-url)
### Algorithms 
Some methods included in scikit image are: 

Isodata, li, mean, minimum, otsu, triangle and yen.


`@script`
There are mainly two categories of thresholding in scikit-image:
Histogram-based. Where the histogram of the pixels’ intensity is used and certain assumptions are made on the properties of this histogram. For example the bimodal histogram.
There is also the local thresholding. This is used to process a pixel, only the neighboring pixels are used. These kind of algorithms often require more computation time.

Methods as Isodata, Li’s iterative Minimum Cross Entropy and otsu are included in scikit image.

## What thresholding algorithm to use

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "f817589f10"
```

`@part1`
```python
from skimage import data
from skimage.filters import try_all_threshold

image = data.page()

fig, ax = try_all_threshold(image, verbose=False)

show_plot()

```


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/66a70de36e3e27742742ec170a947fa4e98bdaa5/trying_all_alg_horizontal.png)


`@script`
You might be asking what thresholding algorithm  would be better to use. It's okay if you don't know in deep how these methods work, scikitimage includes a function to evaluate thresholding algorithms so you can choose the one that best suits you. 

This is the try_all_threshold function.

## Bimodal histogram

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "a9210d59db"
```

`@part1`
```python
from skimage.filters import threshold_minimum

image = data.camera()

min_thresh = threshold_minimum(image)
thresholded_image = image > min_thresh

compare_images_bimodal(image, thresholded_image, min_thresh)
```


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/c6f1ea3a8131fee935101da84e27248abd029d72/bimoal_histogram_horizontal.png)


`@script`
Here, we are using a bimodal hisogram method: the minimum algorithm. It takes a histogram of the image and smooths it repeatedly until there are only two peaks in the histogram.

## Calculating the optimal thresh

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "3306dc3ade"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
```python
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu

image = data.camera()

optimal_thresh = threshold_otsu(image)

thresholded_image = image > optimal_thresh

compare_images_bimodal(image, thresholded_image, optimal_thresh)
```
