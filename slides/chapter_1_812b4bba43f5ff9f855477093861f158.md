## Getting started with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization

Now we are going to get our hands on Scikit-image and start with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization.

## Thresholding

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "2bb9b49fda"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
Partitioning an image into a foreground and background, converting grayscale images into binary images.

e.g. The function T(pixel) will return: {{1}}

- 255 (white) if pixel **>** thresh value {{1}}
- 0 (black) if pixel **<** thresh value {{1}}


`@part2`
```python
import skimage.data as data

img = data.camera()

thresh = 200

```{{2}}
```python
thresholded_image = img > thresh

show_image(thresholded_image)
```{{3}}

`@script`
A function that takes 2 arguments: the image pixel and the thresh value to compare with.

Essentially, its converting the image completely black and white. It's used to create a binary image from a gray-scale one. It's the simplest method, yet effective, of image segmentation, something that we will cover in more detail later on, in the course. It help us to separate objects from a background.


The Thresholding function will return a white pixel, which is 255, if the pixel its evaluating is greater than the thresh value to compare with. And will return a black pixel otherwise.
