## Getting started with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "45a44c3164"
```

`@lower_third`

name: Rebeca Gonzalez
title: Data Engineer


`@script`
Now we are going to get our hands on Scikit-image and start with Thresholding and Histogram Equalization.


---
## Thresholding

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "2bb9b49fda"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
Partitioning an image into a foreground and background, converting grayscale images into binary images.

e.g. The function T(pixel) will return: {{2}}

- 255 (white) if pixel **>** thresh value {{2}}
- 0 (black) if pixel **<** thresh value {{2}}


Works better in gray-scale images because these only use one channel. {{3}}


`@part2`

`@script`
Thresholding help us to separate objects from a background by creating a binary image from a gray-scale one.

Essentially, its converting the image completely black and white. Also the simplest method, yet effective, of image segmentation, something that we will cover in more detail later on, in the course. 

In this way, is a function that takes 2 arguments: the image pixel and a thresh value to compare with.

It will return a white pixel, which is 255, if the pixel that's evaluating is greater than the thresh value to compare with. And will return a black pixel otherwise.

Here we can see how it takes effect on an image. 

Works its best in gray-scale images because these only use one channel.

## Inverted thresholding

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "a9ac55415c"
```

`@part1`
The opposite of the positive thresholding.
 
The function T(pixel) will return: {{1}}

- 255 (white) if pixel **<** thresh value {{1}}
- 0 (black) if pixel **>** thresh value {{1}}


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/e418d89a0a22e0660ac6d7abeca46d18fa81977f/camera_inverted_thresholding.png){{1}}


`@script`
There is also inverted thresholding, this one acts just in the opposite way of the positive thresholding, the one that we just saw.

The background of this image, instead of being white (which is 255), is black (0).

## Apply it

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "714e04f902"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
```python
import skimage.data as data

image = data.camera()

thresh = 127

```{{1}}
```python
thresholded_image = image > thresh
inv_thresholded_image = image <= thresh

show_images(image, 
            thresholded_image, 
            inv_thresholded_image)
```{{2}}
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/68321ee87a6c9805730b7aa83586f6df8e34ed28/all_thresholding.png){{2}}


`@part2`
The module data in scikit image contains multiple images for testing. {{1}}

We apply thresholding using the "**>**" operator. {{2}} 

To apply inverted thresholding we can use "**<=**" operator. {{2}}


`@script`
Let's now apply it.

First we need an image to work on, for this we'll use a module from scikitimage that includes many images for testing reasons. We import the module, then choose a grayscaled image: camera, set the thresh value to 127, which is the whole number midpoint between 0 and 255.

We apply thresholding on an image using the grater than operator followed of the thresh. 

For inverted thresholding, we use the less or equal than operator. 

Finally show the image using a pre-loaded function that plots using matplotlib to help us focus on scikit image, called show_images.

## Types of Thresholding

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "74c101ba7b"
```

`@part1`
- **Histogram-based:** The histogram of the pixels’ intensity is used and certain assumptions are made on the properties of this histogram. Good for images with uniform backgrounds.
- **Local:** Processes a pixel, only the neighboring pixels are used. Best for images with large variation in the background intensity. Often require more computation time.

### Algorithms 
Some methods included in scikit-image are: 

Isodata, li, mean, minimum, otsu, triangle and yen.


`@script`
There are mainly two categories of thresholding in scikit-image:
Histogram-based. The histogram is a graphical representation of the frequency distribution table of the pixels intensity values. It acts based on the properties of this. Good for uniform backgrounds.
Local thresholding: used to process a pixel, where only the neighboring pixels are used. Best for images where the background is not easily differentiated.

Methods as Isodata, Li’s iterative Minimum Cross Entropy and otsu are included in scikit-image.

## What thresholding algorithm to use

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "f817589f10"
```

`@part1`
```python
from skimage import data
from skimage.filters import try_all_threshold

image = data.page()

fig, ax = try_all_threshold(image, verbose=False)

show_plot()

```


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/66a70de36e3e27742742ec170a947fa4e98bdaa5/trying_all_alg_horizontal.png)


`@script`
You might be asking what algorithm would be better to use. It's okay if you don't know in deep how these methods work, scikit-image includes a function to evaluate them so you can choose the one that best suits you.

This is the try_all_threshold function, from the filters module.

Here we import it, set the image from data, use the function and show results.

## Bimodal histogram and calculating the optimal thresh

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "3306dc3ade"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
```python
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu

image = data.camera()

optimal_thresh = threshold_otsu(image)

thresholded_image = image > optimal_thresh

compare_images_bimodal(image, thresholded_image, optimal_thresh)
```


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/fe54cd5bbd915b2379abdbcac98bfcb10ff4cf40/optimal_thresh.png)


`@script`
Previously, we manually set the thresh value, but a better way to know what thresh could work better on an image is to calculate the optimal with a bimodal histogram method. In this case the otsu algorithm.

This is a clustering-based method that maximizes the variance between two classes of pixels, separated by the threshold.

And is done with the threshold_otsu function.

Faster than manually trying numbers.

We can see how the optimal thresh is spotted by a red line in the histogram.


---
## Local thresholding

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e35b09e530"
```

`@part1`
Best for images with different lighting conditions and that doesn't have high contrast
```python
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu, threshold_local

image = data.page()
block_size = 35

local_thresh = threshold_local(image, block_size, offset=10)
local_thresholded = image > local_thresh

show_image(local_thresholded)
```
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/6e1089abb6cbe6c1041c9953d42e777670c9937c/local_thresholding.png)


`@script`
If the image doesn't have high contrast, local or adaptive thresholding produce better results. 

With threshold_local function, we calculate thresholds in regions with a characteristic size block_size surrounding each pixel.

## Histogram Equalization

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "a3c2191b37"
```

`@part1`
- Histogram equalization is a technique used to enhance contrast in images.

```python
from skimage import data
from skimage import exposure

image = data.moon()

img_eq =  exposure.equalize_hist(image)

img_adapthist = exposure.equalize_adapthist(image, clip_limit=0.03)

show_images(image, img_eq, img_adapthist)
```


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4365/datasets/5709225eb725b7f283625fcd25a77d60c4794969/histogram_equalization.png)


`@script`
Remember that histogram is a graphical representation of tonal distribution. 

Histogram equalization is a technique used to enhance contrast.  Tries to spreads out the most frequent intensity values in an image.
